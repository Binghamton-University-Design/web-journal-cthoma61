	<p>I want my digital story to be about Rainbow Six Siege, a game that is trending today but is declining as time goes on because game developers and designers are not supporting it as strongly as in the past. The game is 7 years old and has been a part of my life for so long. The game is strategic and hard to play for the first time. My purpose is to help players in being better.
	Nowadays the only way to become a better player is to look at YouTube videos made by people that do the stats for a game and the viewer must watch the whole video to get information which will take a long time for being a new player today. There are excel sheets that show the weapon stats for a game, but it takes a while to understand the best way to do it in such a way. The solution to these problems is my story of a website. 
	I want to help players, including myself, to be better at the game in a short amount of time. The best way to do that is with a storyboard. I want to create a story about the weapon stats, patch notes, maps, and spawn peeks to help a player be good at a game. The story will include a visually appealing way and could be information design based to communicate effectively and quickly to the user.
	I want the user experience to be the best possible. A good scenario is that a player dies in a round and then must wait around 4 minutes for the next round to spawn. They could look at my website to know where to go next on the map or learn while they are waiting for the match to be over. I want the website to load fast and get straight to the point of what they want with the lowest number of clicks. The faster everything goes the more time they can spend on the website before the round is over.
	There are a few different aspects of my website that will go with the storytelling of my website. First are the gun stats, I want a structure of assault rifles and sub-machine guns in a grid-like structure showing the numerical time to kill which is the most important stat in this game. I want to have illustrations of each gun that will help new players find the gun they are using the most. It may be a lot of hard work to come up with illustrations for each gun unless I do just the outlines of them and very simplified. 
	The next one is the map room locations. People in the community like to call out where an enemy is, and they say the room that they are in. Many average players have no idea which room they are talking about and myself included. Having a map ready to go to give callouts will help decrease the confusion and significantly provide more intel to the rest of the team. Map knowledge is crucial to many games. I will probably use the companies’ maps and mark the camera spots and spawn peeks with circles. Blue circles will mean cameras and red circles will mean spawn peeks. 
	My next part would be to add short spawn peek gifs for prob 3 to 5 maps. There are a lot of maps in the game to do which may be a lot of work. I could grab various shorts of people spawn peeking from YouTube or try recording myself. The short gifs can be like 2 seconds long.
	My last part would be a link to the most recent patch notes. It’s quite hard to find where the game owner, “Ubisoft” put the patch notes, so a direct link to the nerfs and buffs of each operator will help a lot. Patch notes are important to know in case some part of the game was completely changed without even knowing.

	The website will have some copyright issues. As the website is about a video game that has ownership under a company. The statistics will also be gained from a YouTuber called Rogue-9 which I may have a chance in contacting his team for usage rights. This website is for a school project and not for profit, which they may not have a problem with. 
	The aspects of the game are what I want to showcase in my digital story. In some respects, it is like having a story about a character in a book with the various aspects of that character introduced throughout a story. I want my story to be very useful and not just for show.
